I am Bastián M, Master’s in Civil Engineering and Civil Engineer from the University of Concepción. I completed my master’s thesis on the hydrodynamic interaction of supercritical flow with emerging obstacles through advanced numerical simulations using RANS (Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes equations) with VOF (Volume of Fluid) in OpenFoam.

My skills include teaching numerical discretization methods and simulation using tools such as Iber, OpenFoam, Epanet, and Hec-Ras, among others. I have advanced experience in software such as AutoCAD, QGIS, Civil 3D, and hydraulic and network simulation tools, with a particular focus on using OpenFoam and Epanet for advanced analysis and simulations.

Additionally, I am proficient in programming languages such as Python, Visual Basic, and MATLAB, with an intermediate level in web development (HTML5, CSS, Bootstrap).
