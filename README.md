## 👋 About Me
I am Bastián Martínez, Master’s in Civil Engineering and Civil Engineer from the University of Concepción. I completed my master’s thesis on the hydrodynamic interaction of supercritical flow with emerging obstacles through advanced numerical simulations using RANS (Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes equations) with VOF (Volume of Fluid) in OpenFoam.

## 💡 My Skills

### 🌊 Hydraulic Simulation Skills
I specialize in hydraulic simulations and modeling, with expertise in various tools and techniques for analyzing fluid dynamics and water systems.

**Software & Tools:**  
- **Iber** – Hydraulic modeling software for river and flood analysis.  
- **OpenFoam** – Advanced open-source tool for computational fluid dynamics (CFD).  
- **Epanet** – Software for modeling water distribution systems.  
- **Hec-Ras** – River analysis system used for hydraulic and sediment transport modeling.  

**Key Projects:**  
- **River Simulation Project** – Applied OpenFoam to simulate river flow and interaction with structures, analyzing water flow patterns and potential flood scenarios.  
- **Flood Risk Analysis** – Used Epanet to model and optimize water distribution systems for flood prevention.

### 💻 Programming Languages & Web Development
Additionally, I am proficient in programming languages such as:

**Languages:**  
- **Python** 🐍  
- **Visual Basic** 💻  
- **MATLAB** 🔢  

With an intermediate level in web development:  
- **HTML5** 🌐  
- **CSS** 🎨  
- **Bootstrap** 🚀  

Feel free to explore my projects or reach out for collaboration opportunities in software development and web technologies.
